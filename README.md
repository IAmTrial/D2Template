## Can I use this HD mod file for my own purposes?

The GNU Affero GPL License version 3 permits you to utilize this project's binaries and code. However, you must follow the distribution rules of the license. I will not make any exceptions.

## Previous revisions were licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0. Can I use these older revisions with this license?

For most revisions, the answer is likely no. I am not a lawyer and I will not provide support for these older revisions. 

The main reason for making this change is due to license violations that have very likely occurred by utilizing the code of other GPL projects. The following (A)GPL projects were examined in order to ensure maximum comptability. In addition, various design patterns have been inspired by them:
* PlugY
* BH (planqi's branch)

As a result, the project has been "relicensed" to Affero GPL v3+ in order to prevent potential violations.
